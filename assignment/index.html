    <p>How do I create a space between my first and last name in Line 16 of my js file code?</p>
    <p>When creating conditionals for number values, is it necessary to use the == sign or can you just use the = sign? (See Line 77)- Thanks!</p>
    <p> On Line 96, would it be better to write the code as (see below) or is it okay to keep my else if statement?
